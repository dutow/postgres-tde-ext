# `pg_tde` documentation

`pg_tde` is the extension that brings in [Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)](tde.md) to PostgreSQL and enables users to keep sensitive data safe and secure. It allows users to configure encryption differently for each database, encrypting specific tables in some databases with different encryption keys, while keeping others non encrypted. 

!!! important 

    This is the tech preview version of the extension and is not meant for production use yet.

## What's encrypted

`pg_tde` encrypts the following:

* User data in tables, including TOAST tables, that are created using the extension. Metadata of those tables is not encrypted. 
* Write-Ahead Log (WAL) data for tables created using the extension 
* Temporary tables created during the database operation for data tables created using the extension

## Known limitations

* Logical replication is not available as it doesn't work with encrypted tables.
* Keys in the local keyfile are stored unencrypted.
* Indexes and `NULL` bitmaps of tuples are currently not encrypted. 

<i warning>:material-alert: Warning:</i> Note that introducing encryption/decryption affects performance. Our benchmark tests show less than 10% performance overhead for most situations, but in some specific applications, such as JSONB operations, performance degradation might be higher.

## Supported PostgreSQL versions

`pg_tde` is currently based on PostgreSQL 16.0 and supported for Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL 16.x and upstream PostgreSQL 16.x. 

## Future releases

The following is planned for future releases of `pg_tde`:

* Encryption of indexes and `NULL` bitmaps of tuples
* Logical replication support
